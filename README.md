# Spotify-ETL-pipeline

This project showcases a comprehensive data engineering pipeline built on the Spotify API. It involves seamless integration with the Spotify API to extract data and utilizes AWS Lambda for automated extraction. To ensure regular data extraction, a scheduled-trigger using AWS CloudWatch is implemented. The extracted data is then transformed by applying custom transformations written in Python within the Lambda function. The transformation process is automated by adding an S3 trigger. The transformed data is securely stored in S3. For efficient data analysis, analytics tables are created using AWS Glue and Athena. Additionally, the project utilizes the spotipy_layer, an added layer in AWS Lambda, to access the spotipy library for enhanced functionality.
